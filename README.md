In this project, I developed an end-to-end application for classifying SMS messages as either spam or not using the Naïve Bayes classification algorithm. I used the UCI SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which consists of SMS messages labeled as "ham" (non-spam) or "spam." I enriched the dataset by adding features such as message length and the count of non-alphabetical, non-numeric characters. I employed the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to transform text messages into numerical feature vectors and utilized the Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm for classification. The model was trained on the labeled dataset, allowing it to predict whether a new SMS message is spam or not. Additionally, I employed violin plots to visualize data distributions, providing an insightful representation of the dataset. This project serves as a practical solution for automating the detection of spam SMS messages, enhancing user communication security and efficiency.
